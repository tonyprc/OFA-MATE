<seg id="1">THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE ROSE</seg>
<seg id="2">from The Happy Prince and Other Tales by Oscar Wilde first published by David Nutt 1888 </seg>
<seg id="3">"She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses," cried the young Student; "but in all my garden there is no red rose." </seg>
<seg id="4">From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.</seg>
<seg id="5">"No red rose in all my garden!" he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears. </seg>
<seg id="6">"Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!</seg>
<seg id="7">I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Here at last is a true lover," said the Nightingale. </seg>
<seg id="9">"Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him. </seg>
<seg id="10">His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night," murmured the young Student, "and my love will be of the company. </seg>
<seg id="12">If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.</seg>
<seg id="13">If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine. </seg>
<seg id="14">But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.</seg>
<seg id="15">She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Here indeed is the true lover," said the Nightingale.</seg>
<seg id="17">"What I sing of, he suffers: what is joy to me, to him is pain. </seg>
<seg id="18">Surely Love is a wonderful thing. </seg>
<seg id="19">It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals. </seg>
<seg id="20">Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the market-place.</seg>
<seg id="21">It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The musicians will sit in their gallery," said the young Student, "and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin. </seg>
<seg id="23">She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her. </seg>
<seg id="24">But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her;" and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Why is he weeping?" asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Why, indeed?" said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Why, indeed?" whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He is weeping for a red rose," said the Nightingale.</seg>
<seg id="29">"For a red rose?" they cried; "how very ridiculous!" and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.</seg>
<seg id="30">But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.</seg>
<seg id="31">Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. </seg>
<seg id="32">She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."</seg>
<seg id="35">But the Tree shook its head.</seg>
<seg id="36">"My roses are white," it answered; "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="37">But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want."</seg>
<seg id="38">So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."</seg>
<seg id="40">But the Tree shook its head.</seg>
<seg id="41">"My roses are yellow," it answered; "as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe. </seg>
<seg id="42">But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's window, and perhaps he will give you what you want."</seg>
<seg id="43">So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student's window.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."</seg>
<seg id="45">But the Tree shook its head.</seg>
<seg id="46">"My roses are red," it answered, "as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern. </seg>
<seg id="47">But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."</seg>
<seg id="48">"One red rose is all I want," cried the Nightingale, "only one red rose! </seg>
<seg id="49">Is there no way by which I can get it?"</seg>
<seg id="50">"There is a way," answered the Tree; "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."</seg>
<seg id="51">"Tell it to me," said the Nightingale, "I am not afraid."</seg>
<seg id="52">"If you want a red rose," said the Tree, "you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart's-blood. </seg>
<seg id="53">You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn. </seg>
<seg id="54">All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine."</seg>
<seg id="55">"Death is a great price to pay for a red rose," cried the Nightingale, "and Life is very dear to all.</seg>
<seg id="56">It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl. </seg>
<seg id="57">Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill. </seg>
<seg id="58">Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?"</seg>
<seg id="59">So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. </seg>
<seg id="60">She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.</seg>
