<seg id="1">THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE ROSE</seg>
<seg id="1">夜莺与蔷薇</seg>
<seg id="2">from The Happy Prince and Other Tales by Oscar Wilde, 1888</seg>
<seg id="2">选自《快乐王子集》 [英]奥斯卡·王尔德著;巴金译, 1957年</seg>
<seg id="3">"She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses," cried the young Student; "but in all my garden there is no red rose."</seg>
<seg id="3">“她说过只要我送给她一朵红蔷薇，她就会同我跳舞，”年青的学生大声说；“可是我的花园里，连一朵红蔷薇也没有。”</seg>
<seg id="4">From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.</seg>
<seg id="4">夜莺在她的常青橡树上的巢里听见了他的话，她从绿叶丛中向外张望，非常惊讶。</seg>
<seg id="5">"No red rose in all my garden!" he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears. "Ah, on what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched."</seg>
<seg id="5">“找遍我整个花园都找不到一朵红蔷薇，”他带哭说，他美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水。“唉，想不到幸福就系在这么细小的事情上面，我读过了那班聪明人写的东西，一切学问的秘密我都知道了，可是因为少了一朵红蔷薇，我的生活就变成很不幸的了。”</seg>
<seg id="6">"Here at last is a true lover," said the Nightingale. "Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him. His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow."</seg>
<seg id="6">“现在到底找到一个忠实的情人了，”夜莺自语道。“我虽然不认识他，可是我每夜都在歌颂他。我一夜又一夜地把他的故事讲给星星听，现在我亲眼看见他了。他的头发黑得像盛开的风信子，他的嘴唇就像他想望的蔷薇那样红。可是热情使他的脸变得像一块失色的象牙，忧愁已经印上他的眉梢了。”</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night," murmured the young Student, "and my love will be of the company. If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn. If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine. But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by. She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break."</seg>
<seg id="7">“王子明晚要开跳舞会，”年青的学生喃喃说，“我所爱的人要去赴会。要是我带一朵红蔷薇去送她，她便会同我跳舞到天亮。要是我送她一朵红蔷薇，我便可以搂着她，让她的头靠在我肩上，她的手捏在我手里。可是我的园子里并没有红蔷薇，因此我就不得不寂寞地枯坐在那儿，她会走过我面前不理我。她不会理睬我，我的心就要碎了。”</seg>
<seg id="8">"Here indeed is the true lover," said the Nightingale. "What I sing of, he suffers: what is joy to me, to him is pain. Surely Love is a wonderful thing. It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the market-place. It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold."</seg>
<seg id="8">“这的确是一个忠实的情人，”夜莺说。“我所歌唱的，正是使他受苦的东西。在我是快乐的东西，在他却成了痛苦。爱情真是一件了不起的东西。它比绿宝石更宝贵，比猫眼石更值价。用珠宝也买不到它。它不是陈列在市场上的，它不是可以从商人那儿买到的，也不能称轻重拿来换钱。”</seg>
<seg id="9">"The musicians will sit in their gallery," said the young Student, "and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin. She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her. But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her;" and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.</seg>
<seg id="9">“乐师们会坐在他们的廊厢里，”年青的学生说，“弹奏他们的弦乐器，我所爱的人会跟着竖琴和小提琴的声音跳舞。她会跳得那么轻快，好像她的脚就没有挨着地板似的，那些穿漂亮衣服的朝臣会团团地围住她。可是她不会同我跳舞，因为我没有红蔷薇带给她，”于是他扑倒在草地上，双手蒙住脸哭起来。</seg>
<seg id="10">"Why is he weeping?" asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.</seg>
<seg id="10">“他为什么哭？”一条小小的绿蜥蜴竖起尾巴跑过学生面前，这样问道。</seg>
<seg id="11">"Why, indeed?" said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.</seg>
<seg id="11">“的确，为的什么？”一只蝴蝶说，他正跟着一线日光飞舞。</seg>
<seg id="12">"Why, indeed?" whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.</seg>
<seg id="12">“的确，为的什么？”一朵雏菊温和地对他的邻人小声说。</seg>
<seg id="13">"He is weeping for a red rose," said the Nightingale.</seg>
<seg id="13">“他为了一朵红蔷薇在哭，”夜莺答道。</seg>
<seg id="14">"For a red rose?" they cried; "how very ridiculous!" and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.</seg>
<seg id="14">“为了一朵红蔷薇！”他们嚷起来；“多么可笑！”小蜥蜴素来爱讥诮人，他大声笑了。</seg>
<seg id="15">But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.</seg>
<seg id="15">然而夜莺了解学生的烦恼，她默默地坐在橡树枝上，想着爱情的不可思议。</seg>
<seg id="16">Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.</seg>
<seg id="16">突然她张开她的棕色翅膀，往空中飞去。她像影子似地穿过树林，又像影子似地飞过了花园。</seg>
<seg id="17">In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.</seg>
<seg id="17">在草地的中央有一棵美丽的蔷薇树，她看见了那棵树，便飞过去，栖在它的一根小枝上。</seg>
<seg id="18">"Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."</seg>
<seg id="18">“给我一朵红蔷薇，”她大声说，“我要给你唱我最好听的歌。”</seg>
<seg id="19">But the Tree shook its head.</seg>
<seg id="19">可是这棵树摇摇头。</seg>
<seg id="20">"My roses are white," it answered; "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain. But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want."</seg>
<seg id="20">“我的蔷薇是白的，”它回答；“像海里浪花那样白，比山顶的积雪更白。你去找我那个长在旧日晷仪旁边的兄弟吧，也许他会把你要的东西给你。”</seg>
<seg id="21">So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.</seg>
<seg id="21">夜莺便飞到那棵生长在日晷仪旁边的蔷薇树上去。</seg>
<seg id="22">"Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."</seg>
<seg id="22">“给我一朵红蔷薇，”她大声说，“我要给你唱我最好听的歌。”</seg>
<seg id="23">But the Tree shook its head.</seg>
<seg id="23">可是这棵树摇摇它的头。</seg>
<seg id="24">"My roses are yellow," it answered; "as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe. But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's window, and perhaps he will give you what you want."</seg>
<seg id="24">“我的蔷薇是黄的，”它答道，“就像坐在琥珀宝座上的美人鱼的头发那样黄，比刈草人带着嫌刀到来以前在草地上开花的水仙更黄。去找我那个长在学生窗下的兄弟吧，也许他会把你要的东西给你。”</seg>
<seg id="25">So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student's window.</seg>
<seg id="25">夜莺便飞到那棵长在学生窗下的蔷薇树上去。</seg>
<seg id="26">"Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."</seg>
<seg id="26">“给我一朵红蔷薇，”她大声说，“我要给你唱我最好听的歌。”</seg>
<seg id="27">But the Tree shook its head.</seg>
<seg id="27">可是这棵树摇摇它的头。</seg>
<seg id="28">"My roses are red," it answered, "as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern. But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."</seg>
<seg id="28">“我的蔷薇是红的，”它答道，“像鸽子脚那样红，比在海洋洞窟中扇动的珊瑚大扇更红。可是冬天已经冻僵了我的脉管，霜已经冻枯了我的花苞，风雨已经打折了我的树枝，我今年不会再开花了。”</seg>
<seg id="29">"One red rose is all I want," cried the Nightingale, "only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">“我只要一朵红蔷薇，”夜莺叫道。“只是一朵红蔷薇！我还有什么办法可以得到它吗？”</seg>
<seg id="30">"There is a way," answered the Tree; "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."</seg>
<seg id="30">“有一个办法，”树答道；“只是那太可怕了，我不敢对你说。”</seg>
